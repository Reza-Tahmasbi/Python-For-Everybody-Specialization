You do not need to export or convert the database - simply upload the .sqlite file that your program creates. See the example code for the use of the connect() statement.

Musical Track Database
This application will read an iTunes export file in XML and produce a properly normalized database with this structure:

CREATE TABLE Artist (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    name    TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Genre (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    name    TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Album (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    artist_id  INTEGER,
    title   TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Track (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY 
        AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    title TEXT  UNIQUE,
    album_id  INTEGER,
    genre_id  INTEGER,
    len INTEGER, rating INTEGER, count INTEGER
);
If you run the program multiple times in testing or with different files, make sure to empty out the data before each run.

You can use this code as a starting point for your application: http://www.py4e.com/code3/tracks.zip. The ZIP file contains the Library.xml file to be used for this assignment. You can export your own tracks from iTunes and create a database, but for the database that you turn in for this assignment, only use the Library.xml data that is provided.

To grade this assignment, the program will run a query like this on your uploaded database and look for the data it expects to see:

SELECT Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name 
    FROM Track JOIN Genre JOIN Album JOIN Artist 
    ON Track.genre_id = Genre.ID and Track.album_id = Album.id 
        AND Album.artist_id = Artist.id
    ORDER BY Artist.name LIMIT 3
The expected result of the modified query on your database is:


Track	Artist	Album	Genre
Chase the Ace	AC/DC	Who Made Who	Rock
D.T.	AC/DC	Who Made Who	Rock
For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)	AC/DC	Who Made Who	Rock
